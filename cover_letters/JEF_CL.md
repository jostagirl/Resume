Dear J.E. Fuller technical teams,

Brian mentioned you may be evaluating technical needs and priorities for the coming year, so I wanted to share my background given how closely my experience aligns with the type of integration and telemetry work J.E. Fuller delivers. I can emediately contribute in a way that strengthens your operations and supports your growth plans for the coming year.

I have spent the last 13 years working in environmental monitoring, road-weather systems, and telemetry integration, much of which is closely aligned with the type of system design, validation, and maintenance workflows J.E. Fuller supports. My strengths are in simplifying complex systems, improving pre-deployment workflows, and building clarity around hardware, firmware, and cloud integrations so teams can operate more efficiently.

In previous roles, I have also helped my organization move from informal support processes to more structured triage systems. If you decide to pursue a ticketing or support workflow project, that is an area where I can step in quickly and add value.

I am open to discussing full-time opportunities when the timing makes sense for your team, and I am also available for defined contract work if you have a short-term need while planning for the year ahead.

Thank you for taking the time to review my resume. I would be glad to connect if you see a potential fit or would like to explore options.

Sincerely,

Anna Bellizzi
