Dear Hiring Team at First Due,

I am excited to express my interest in joining First Due and contributing to your continued growth and innovation. I was introduced to the company by Jesse Hodorowski, who speaks highly of the team and encouraged me to explore opportunities aligned with my background.

For over 13 years, I have supported public works teams, emergency managers, DOTs, cities, counties, and fire agencies who rely on mission-critical weather and flood monitoring data to protect their communities. Across that work, I’ve built a reputation as the person teams turn to when complex problems need to be untangled, when clarity is missing, or when multiple groups need to be brought into alignment.

My colleagues often describe me as a “go-to problem solver," someone who learns quickly, thrives during transition and change, and is able to translate complex technical issues into clear, actionable steps for both technical and non-technical teams. Whether supporting an ERP implementation, working through a multi-agency system upgrade, or helping a customer make sense of unfamiliar data, I am consistently relied on for calm, thoughtful analysis and the ability to keep work moving in the right direction.

What I enjoy most is being the connective layer that makes cross-functional work easier. I take pride in bringing structure to ambiguous situations, mentoring teammates, and ensuring the right details reach the right people. My approach has always been customer-first and relationship-focused, because in public safety and emergency management, clarity and reliability are just as important as technical accuracy.

I’m drawn to First Due because the company builds tools that give agencies the situational awareness and operational confidence they deserve. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to that mission and bring forward the same reliability, curiosity, and problem-solving mindset that have defined my work across the public sector.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be glad to discuss how my background and approach could support your team.

Sincerely,


Anna Bellizzi
